## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

1. What are the most favorite programming languages for the developers and what do they recommend for the future? 
2.	Is there any relationship between Age and salary? Is there any relationship between weekly working hours and salary?
3. Can we build a machine learning model to predict the salary?



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 
There is a word document for the blog I wrote. I do not want to publish it publicly, instead, I want to publish it privately.

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
